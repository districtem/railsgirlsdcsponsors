====================

['Check out the demo here'](http://rpearce.github.io/railsgirlsdcsponsors)

# Getting Started
Just include the following code where you want it!

```html
<div class="grid_12">
  <section class="sponsors"></section>
  <script async src="js/sponsors.js"></script>
</div>
```

# Info
In order to avoid repetitive code, and to be able to easily add new sponsors and sponsor groups in the future, I added a "sponsors.js" file with comments, which can easily be edited to add/update/remove sponsors and their group types.

## Note
You may have to adjust the image sizes of some of the images, but none of them are over 300px wide.
